# Anime Shoutout

## About
A Next.js app for anime fans like me to recommend, discover and discuss anime shows. Fans can log onto the site using Google Cloud Storage authentication.

## Purpose
This aim of this project was to get start on learning TypeScript with React.js. I was also able to implement some animations using Framer Motion which is what I learnt from building the filter animation project. This project also taught me how to build a Next.js app with multiple pages and models, using PostgreSQL and Google Cloud Storage authentication. 

## Challenges
I initially found it quite difficult to wrap my head around the use of Props and PropTypes in React.js but it proved extremely beneficial learning about this language when identifying and resolving errors.

## Next Steps
While this was also a great opportunity for me to use Tailwind to create a simple design, I would like to add more colour and interactivity to the app. In future, I also plan to add two more models, heart and save, so that users can like and save posts to refer back to at a later date, giving them a place to store a list of anime recommendations. And to make it more fun I want to add a Spotify anime playlist to play some anime themed music!
