# Anime Shoutout

## About
A Next.js app for anime fans like me to recommend, discover and discuss anime shows. Fans can log onto the site using Google Cloud Storage authentication.

## Purpose
This aim of this project was to get start on learning TypeScript with React.js. I was also able to implement some animations using Framer Motion which is what I learnt from building the filter animation project. This project also taught me how to build a Next.js app with multiple pages and models, using PostgreSQL and Google Cloud Storage authentication. 

## Challenges
I initially found it quite difficult to wrap my head around the use of PropTypes in React.js but it proved extremely beneficial learning this skill when resolving errors.

## Next Steps
While this was also a great opportunity for me to use Tailwind to create a simple design, I would like to add more colour and interactivity to the app. In future, I also plan to add two more models, heart and save, so that users can like and save posts to refer back to at a later date, giving them a place to store a list of anime recommendations. And to make it more fun I want to add a Spotify anime playlist to play some anime themed music!
